# Frozen—not in time

## Overview

- *Fork this repository.*
- Export the graphics as SVGs from Adobe Illustrator.
- Create the introductory banner graphic (where the pieces animate in 1-by-1) using `animation`, `@keyframes`, `transform`, `filter` & `opacity`
- Each ice cream cone piece should be a separate `<img>` tag.
- Before adding any animations position the ice cream cone pieces into the right locations so you know their final coordinates.
- Use a grid to get the text and the ice cream cone beside each other.
- Use a `repeating-linear-gradient()` to create the stripy background pattern.
- Text can be found inside the `content.txt` file.
- *Run it through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*

## Goal

Visually match the images in the “screenshots” folder and create the interaction shown in the linked video.

- Final screenshots in the “screenshots” folder.
- [**Watch this video to see how it interacts.**](https://youtu.be/o2FwGlunLnw)
  *This video shows the browser being refreshed a few times—the components only need to animate in once.*
